# Polya-Gamma-Gibbs-Sampler
This repository contains the work I endured during my Master's Thesis in Stochastics and Data Science on Bayesian Poisson regression. My work introduced a Gibbs sampling procedure based on a data augmentation scheme with Polya-Gamma random variables, which is then compared with state-of-art algorithms.
